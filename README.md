# 🎮 Hangman Game - Python Edition

## 📝 Description
The **Hangman Game** is a classic word-guessing game built in **Python**! Players attempt to guess a randomly selected word by suggesting letters, all while trying to avoid running out of lives.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Random word selection from a predefined list
- ✅ Real-time display of guessed letters and word progress
- ✅ A lives system - incorrect guesses reduce chances
- ✅ Winning and losing messages for an interactive experience
- ✅ Simple yet effective game logic, great for Python learners

## 🎯 How to Play
1. The game randomly selects a word.
2. The player guesses one letter at a time.
3. If the letter is correct, it appears in the word.
4. If incorrect, the player loses a life.
5. The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of lives.
